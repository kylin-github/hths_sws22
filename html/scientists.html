        <div class="panel">
            <p id="faq">"I am senior instructor at Western Governors University, an online university that centers around training science teachers.  I am the instructor for over 20 different science courses ranging from introductory science courses to advanced chemistry courses.  I received my bachelor’s degree from Monmouth University in chemistry, then I went to Rutgers University for my PhD and then I did a post-doctoral position at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, MA. My grad school research looked at designing metal catalysts for different chemical reactions and then in my post-doc position, I looked at recycling rare earth metals, the elements on the bottom of the periodic table, from computers and electric cars. In grad school and during my post-doctoral work, I spent a lot of time in the laboratory doing research and using lots of cool chemistry equipment.  Now, I get to share my experiences and mentor new science teachers who will work across the country in classrooms.  Every day I get to teach different science topics, talk about fun lab activities to demonstrate and help teachers plan the lessons that they will use to inspire students to become future scientists."  </p>

            <p id="faq">"I am responsible for oversight of a robust education program for New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium located on Sandy Hook.  Education programs offered include outdoor experiential learning in environmental science and STEM such as field trips, scout programs and summer camp.  We also have in-school programs and offer college classes from our location.  We have recently developed an apprenticeship program to introduce high school students to aquaculture as an emerging food source and career opportunity.  Aside from curriculum development and program implementation, I secure and manage grant-funded programs and build community relations and interactions with stakeholders.  I hold a BS in Biology and MS in Wildlife Biology, as well as graduate credits in education."  </p>

            <p id="faq">"I work in the field of telecommunications, specifically on the high-speed, long-haul fiber-optic systems that enable the internet, the “cloud”, and landline and cellular phone calls.  I work to improve the transmission of the voice and data traffic, which is encoded as bits on light signals and sent over 100’s and 1000’s of kilometers of optical fiber.  In college I majored in electrical engineering, and then I went on to graduate school and earned my Masters and PhD, also in “double E”.  After finishing my education, for 15 years I did research on optical transmission and conducted experiments in collaboration with colleagues at Lucent Technologies/Bell Labs and AT&T.  I enjoyed writing papers for journals and presenting my results at conferences.  Then I moved to a development role at AT&T, working as a system engineer and currently as Director of the Optical Platforms Development group.  My group works on the design and deployment of the newest optical systems for AT&T’s network.  The best parts of my job are having independence and some flexibility with my schedule (important for a working mom), working with smart people (many of whom are from different states and countries), and learning something new every day!"  </p>

            <p id="faq">"I am a Research Engineer in the Coastal Engineering Research Group at Stevens Institute of Technology.  We receive research money from various groups and agencies to study and advise on shoreline stabilization projects happening predominantly throughout New Jersey.  What that means: Our beaches, coastlines and marshes are eroding.  All of these areas protect people and infrastructure and provide for recreation, tourism and other commercial dollars in our state and are, therefore, incredibly valuable.  We (our group which includes professors, engineers, scientists and students of all levels from undergraduate through PhD) study them and try to figure out how they can be done better.  We do a lot of field research - collecting data on waves and water level and mapping beaches (for this I fly a drone and ride a jetski!) and shorelines to see how they are changing and try to figure out why.  We also work on engineering solutions to help them stay where they are or, in some cases, even help them build out or keep up with sea level rise.  I also do work through New Jersey Sea Grant as their Coastal Resilience Specialist and try to help coastal communities figure out how they can become more resilient to rising seas and more frequent and/or intense storms."  </p>
